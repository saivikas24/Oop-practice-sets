Practice Set 2: C++ Basics 
1. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop. 2. Print the first 10 even numbers using a while loop. 
3. Print the multiplication table of a given number using a do-while loop. 4. Find the sum of the first N natural numbers (input N) using a for loop. 
5. Write a program to find the factorial of a number using a while loop. 6. Print the digits of a number in reverse order using a do-while loop. 7. Check whether a number is prime or not using a for loop. 8. Print all odd numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop. 9. Write a program that keeps asking the user for input until they enter a negative number (do-while loop). 
10. Print the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop. 11. Write a program to calculate the power of a number (ab) using a while loop. 
12. Use if-else with a loop: Print “Fizz” if a number is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if divisible by both (for numbers 1 to 50). 
13. Take a number as input and check if it is an Armstrong number using a while loop. 
14. Write a program to find the largest digit in a number using a do-while loop. 
15. Print a simple pattern using loops: 
* 
** 
*** 
**** 
***** 
16. Use a for loop to check if a number is a palindrome. 
17. Write a program to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers using a while loop. 
18. Print the Fibonacci sequence up to N terms using a for loop. 1
19. Use if-else inside a for loop to print whether numbers from 1 to 20 are even or odd. 
20. Write a program to keep taking marks as input until the user enters −1, then print the average of the entered marks.
